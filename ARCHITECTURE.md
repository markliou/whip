# Whip architecture

## Product boundary

Whip is a mobile client for a Herdr server running on another machine. It never starts a local Herdr runtime, shell, or PTY on the device.

The app has three presentation surfaces:

- **Herdr control surfaces become mobile UI.** Herd status, workspaces, tabs, panes, agent actions, settings, notifications, and connection state are React Native screens and sheets backed by structured Herdr state.
- **Pane terminals remain terminals.** When a user opens a shell or agent pane, the app attaches to that pane's terminal stream and renders its ANSI/TUI output faithfully in the terminal renderer.
- **Chat View is another projection of an agent pane.** It renders the Rust-owned normalized transcript for the same pane/session; it does not introduce a separate remote execution path.

The app must not render the full Herdr management TUI in a terminal and place mobile controls around it. Herdr's TUI is one client presentation; Whip is another presentation over the same server-owned state.

## Three planes

### Transport plane

The mobile device reaches a remote machine over SSH. A saved host profile owns host, port, username, authentication reference, Herdr binary path, named Herdr session, optional jump host, and optional agent-forwarding setting.

Metadata is stored in AsyncStorage. Passwords, private keys, and passphrases are stored through the platform credential store and referenced by profile ID; they must never be embedded in profile JSON, logs, screenshots, or fixtures. Android may back up only AES-GCM ciphertext, with its recovery token separated into Block Store. Global SSH keychain secrets are excluded from that recovery path.

Both platforms link one `whip-ssh` static library and expose one WhipSsh TurboModule. The Rust core loads one process-wide OpenSSH-compatible known-host repository, returns typed unknown/changed challenges for explicit fingerprint approval, and parses and validates structured trusted-key records supplied by the platform store. Unsupported SSH host certificates remain a separate typed failure through UniFFI and never enter the ordinary host-key approval flow. React Native owns confirmation UI and durable storage, but never parses native error strings or constructs OpenSSH `known_hosts` lines. Direct hosts and every jump-host hop follow the same rule.

### Control plane

The control plane reads and mutates structured Herdr server state:

- server/version/capabilities
- session snapshot
- workspaces and worktrees
- tabs and panes
- agents, status, metadata, and recent output
- create, focus, rename, split, resize, send, close, and launch actions

Rust `AppCore` is the application layer immediately below the native boundary.
It owns the ordered application sessions across hosts, active-session selection,
client-side workspace/tab/pane selection, selection reconciliation, each
session's logical terminal rail, and the revisioned `AppCoreView`. It also
builds application-level projections such as the multi-host Herd view. Each app
session may reference one `HostRuntime`, but `AppCore` does not duplicate or
replace Herdr server truth: the referenced runtime's `HostState` remains the
authoritative per-host projection.

Whip opens SSH stream-local channels directly to Herdr's local API socket. Short-lived request channels carry structured actions and snapshots; a persistent subscription channel carries events. The `whip-ssh` Rust core owns request IDs and JSON serialization, newline response framing, response/error validation, subscription serialization, incremental JSONL framing, event normalization, and conversion into typed domain events. It also owns cohesive launch semantics: one typed shell/command/agent tab operation performs tab creation and the exact follow-up action, including managed-agent naming and typed partial failure. React Native supplies explicit shell or agent intents for dedicated UI actions and passes command-runner text as a command intent without tokenizing it. Rust alone interprets direct managed-agent command lines, preserves shell-bearing input as an ordinary command, and sequences `tab.create` with exactly one `agent.start` or `pane.send_input`.

Herdr protocol code asks a stable `HerdrConnection` for control, event, or terminal streams; it does not receive an `SshSession`, socket path, stream-local channel ID, framing flag, or SSH generation. The connection owns socket discovery and cached-hint invalidation, selects the API or client socket for the logical stream, filters callbacks from replaced sessions, and cancels in-flight handshakes when its transport is replaced. There is no C ABI, callback context, dynamic symbol lookup, or JSON dispatch between the SSH and Herdr modules. Herdr JSON does not cross the React Native boundary. Rust applies snapshots, events, and confirmed mutation results to one authoritative per-host domain model. TypeScript invokes semantic operations and renders a typed, versioned projection.

Runtime failures cross UniFFI as tagged errors. SSH failures retain a stable `SshErrorCode` plus their diagnostic message, and protocol mismatches retain their expected and received versions. The native TypeScript adapter maps those fields mechanically to presentation codes; React Native does not classify native exception text or extract structured fields with regular expressions.

Transport/runtime timings are measured beside the Rust operations they describe and cross the native boundary as typed, coarse diagnostics. Connect/reconnect, terminal attach/recovery, and event-stream recovery produce one completion diagnostic; latency probes and ordinary Herdr requests produce diagnostics only when slow or failed. Successful latency calls still return a typed Rust-measured RTT/total/overhead record for live UI state. React Native owns bounded diagnostic history, thresholds, persistence, and display. It does not infer transport duration by timing an FFI promise.

One Rust `HostRuntime` owns each connected host's stable
`Arc<HerdrConnection>`, ProxyJump chain, reconnect loop, event subscription, and
Herdr terminal registry. `HerdrConnection` is the sole owner of the installed
authenticated `Arc<SshSession>` and its generation. Reconnect installs a new
session into the same connection object, advances the existing runtime
generation/epoch state, cancels stale work, and restores requested resources
without bouncing through JavaScript. Transcript sources likewise request
generation-guarded commands and logical exec streams from this connection
instead of retaining an SSH session or manufacturing channel IDs. Shell,
remote-file, forwarding, and preview workflows remain HostRuntime operations
and borrow the connection's current owned session; no string-key session alias
is published for React Native.

`HostState` owns workspace/tab/pane topology, layouts, server focus, derived
agent status, snapshot sync generations, monotonic state revisions, and
freshness. Snapshot requests carry both connection and sync generations. Events
that arrive while a snapshot is in flight are applied immediately and buffered,
then replayed over the accepted snapshot so an older response cannot erase
already-observed changes. Herdr does not currently expose a single revision
shared by its request and subscription channels, so Rust coalesces a follow-up
snapshot after gaps or inconsistent references instead of hiding that ordering
limit with delays. `pane.output_changed` is treated as a non-projecting
notification: terminal/transcript bytes and activity use their dedicated
streams, so known-pane output does not mutate the host projection revision or
send a redundant full snapshot.

Successful Herdr mutations are reconciled into Rust-owned `HostState`, and
React Native consumes the resulting projection without routinely requesting a
follow-up full snapshot. Rust alone decides when an incomplete or inconsistent
control result requires a resync. `AppCore` owns durable application/session
selection and repairs it against newer `HostState` revisions. React may retain
transient optimistic focus while an interaction settles, but that renderer-local
state is not the authoritative application selection.

If Whip needs a new server capability, it should be a neutral Herdr socket API method or event, not a mobile-specific endpoint and not a second source of runtime truth.

Herdr's Unix API accepts one normal request and then closes that socket
connection; only subscriptions remain open. Control requests therefore use
separate short-lived stream-local channels. Do not treat the API socket itself
as a multiplexed transport.
A cold connection uses `ping` as the availability handshake and reads the
Herdr version and protocol from its `pong` response. Rust then takes a bootstrap
snapshot to obtain the current pane IDs, opens the complete lifecycle and
per-pane event subscription, waits for Herdr's `subscription_started`
acknowledgement, and takes a reconciliation snapshot while buffering events.
AsyncStorage retains one opaque resolved-socket hint per saved host across app
launches. TypeScript only loads and stores that hint; it has no socket validity,
invalidation, discovery, or replay policy. `HostRuntime` treats the hint as
untrusted, validates it through normal control traffic, and re-resolves it
through its current SSH session if the hinted path stops accepting channels.
Rust selects the
protocol-specific terminal attach variant from the ping result.

`startHerdrServer` is a readiness contract, not merely a remote shell launch.
The runtime serializes callers, probes `session.snapshot` first so an already
running server is not relaunched, starts Herdr only after retryable control-socket
unavailability, and polls native control snapshots to a 12-second deadline with
75–600 ms exponential backoff. Success requires a supported protocol, an
accepted generation-scoped authoritative snapshot, normal event-subscription
reconciliation, and a `HostStateChanged` projection. React Native neither sleeps
nor requests a follow-up snapshot after this operation.

### Terminal plane

Each opened Herdr terminal owns an independent SSH stream-local channel to the
server's client-protocol socket. The Whip Rust core owns protocol validation,
binary encoding/decoding, the `Hello` / `Welcome` / `AttachTerminal` state
machine, prepared connections, and protocol-level cleanup. Its Herdr bridge
asks the shared connection for a logical length-prefixed terminal stream;
terminal frames do not travel through a JavaScript codec, generic JSON event
path, or a second native library. React Native sends
semantic input, resize, scroll, and close operations and receives typed control
events plus raw binary terminal/graphics payloads for the renderer. Do not
substitute the human-facing
`terminal attach` command: nesting that interface inside an SSH PTY leaks shell
chrome and breaks application-level input and resize behavior.

`TerminalAttach` is a direct pane connection. Its input bypasses Herdr's management
prefix router, so Whip must expose workspace, tab, and pane operations as native
actions. Ctrl/Alt and control bytes in the terminal key rail belong to the program
inside the pane; they are not Herdr navigation shortcuts.

Terminal sessions are identified by `terminal_id` and can be switched or closed
independently. Each `AppCore` session owns the ordered logical terminal rail,
its active `terminal_id`, metadata, and application-level lifecycle projection.
The attached `HostRuntime` separately owns the actual terminal registry,
transport lifecycle, restoration, geometry, and bridges. React projects the
rail and keeps terminal WebViews mounted while the user switches hosts, tabs,
and panes; input and resize events are routed to the exact native terminal
connection, and metadata commands never share an interactive shell channel.
Rust terminal lifecycle events include the native retry attempt and whether a
retry remains scheduled. React projects those events for status rendering;
persisted terminal metadata excludes transient transport state.

The renderer is responsible for ANSI color, alternate screen applications, cursor modes, bracketed paste, resize, selection, scrollback, clipboard, and mobile special keys. It does not interpret Herdr management state.

### Rust-owned agent transcripts

Codex and OpenCode panes can expose two presentations of the same live process. The existing
Herdr terminal stream continues to feed the mounted xterm Terminal View. After
the user explicitly opens Chat, the Rust `HostRuntime` uses the pane's Herdr
`agent_session` ID to open an `AgentSessionManager` entry and resolve that exact
Codex rollout or OpenCode export/event source through the existing stable
connection:

```text
Herdr terminal stream       Codex rollout JSONL       OpenCode export + event DB
        |                           |                            |
        v                           v                            v
  Terminal View              Rust agent source/session runtime
                                           |
                             framing / cursors / retry
                                           |
                                           v
                               typed AgentTranscript
                                           |
                                           v
                                   Native Chat View
```

Rust owns rollout identity, byte-oriented JSONL framing, partial lines,
received/committable/durable offsets, source replacement and truncation
detection, catch-up, retry/rebind, and incremental normalization. The shared
connection layer guards the SSH generation and suppresses data and close
callbacks from replaced transcript streams; transcript state uses its own
operation and source epochs for reducer correctness.
Each state projection has a monotonic revision and can be fetched in full, so a
missed callback does not lose transcript correctness. The remote rollout remains
authoritative. Rust constructs the host/agent/session-qualified opaque cache key,
owns the blob schema/version and compatibility checks, and emits a checkpoint
token with each opaque blob. The existing platform SQLite adapter stores only
that key, host namespace, and bytes; it does not compare transcript revisions or
reconstruct session identity. Rust validates and replays the blob before
resuming, and only advances the durable checkpoint after the platform confirms
the blob write. P0 cache rows are migrated once to the Rust key and the obsolete
semantic tables are removed.
Opening Chat first binds the terminal and semantic agent session in Rust. The
platform cache is loaded afterward and starts that exact binding; a late cache
load is rejected natively if the terminal was closed or rebound meanwhile.
Transient source failure retains known content as stale rather than replacing it
with an empty transcript.

`AgentTranscript` is agent-neutral typed domain state: messages, turns, text,
visible reasoning summaries, tools, plans, notices, file diffs, lifecycle status,
and stable source-derived IDs. React Native mechanically projects those records
into the existing render types and retains only UI concerns such as scrolling,
expansion, composition, markdown, and navigation. It does not know rollout paths,
offsets, OpenCode event sequences, JSONL records, or retry policy. OpenCode uses
an official export for a cold snapshot and polls only newer durable events with
`opencode db`; Rust validates sequence continuity and falls back to an export on
divergence. Chat composer submissions return to the same Herdr pane and PTY used
by the mounted terminal.

### Rust-owned remote operations

`HostRuntime` owns Whip's non-UI remote-operation services. Its remote-filesystem
methods normalize Unix paths against the remote home directory and provide typed
directory entries and bounded UTF-8 reads over a generation-scoped lazy SFTP
session. Missing metadata remains absent; failed reads remain errors. React
Native receives absolute entry paths and does not parse `ls` output or assemble
operation paths from strings.

The runtime's `RemoteOperationManager` accepts native local file paths produced
by the Expo picker cache, streams bytes directly between the local file and SFTP, and exposes only
a stable `TransferId`, throttled byte progress, cancellation, and a typed final
result. Uploads write a unique temporary sibling, close it, then rename it into
place. When replacing a file, the previous destination is temporarily preserved
and restored if finalization or cancellation fails. Downloads likewise use a
temporary local sibling and rename only after a complete stream. Connection
replacement fails current transfers instead of attempting an unsafe implicit
resume; stale or cancelled completions cannot become successful. At most four
transfers run per host.

Attachment placement (`~/.whip/uploads`, collision-resistant naming, directory
creation, atomic transfer, and cleanup) is a Rust workflow. React Native retains
file/camera/photo/clipboard selection, preview chips, progress rendering, and
cancel intent. Picker inputs are copied by Expo to an app cache `file://`
location on Android and iOS before Rust opens them, so platform content handles
never become JavaScript/base64 transfer payloads.

The Git operation layer continues to run the remote `git` executable through
SSH, but Rust owns command construction, centralized POSIX shell quoting, exit/output
validation, porcelain `-z` parsing, absolute changed-file paths, and bounded
unified-diff parsing. React Native receives `GitRepository`, typed status entries,
and typed diff rows; it retains only tree grouping and rendering preferences.

The preview portion of `RemoteOperationManager` owns OS-assigned local listeners,
SSH forward/file-server resources, remote HTML server process metadata, cleanup, and idempotent stop.
React Native receives a `PreviewId` and local/display URLs, never a local port or
transport handle. Reconnect marks open previews disconnected and closes their
resources; previews are reopened explicitly instead of silently presenting a
dead URL. At most eight previews are open per host.

## Application and presentation state ownership

Rust owns two distinct levels of state:

- **`AppCore` application state:** application sessions across hosts, the active
  session, client-side workspace/tab/pane selection and repair, ordered logical
  terminal rails and active terminals, Herd aggregation, and revisioned typed
  application projections.
- **`HostRuntime` per-host truth:** connection/reconnect state, authoritative
  `HostState` topology and server focus, synchronization/freshness, terminal
  transports, agent transcript sessions, monitoring, diagnostics, and remote
  operations. `AppCore` references these runtimes; it does not become a second
  owner of Herdr state.

React Native owns presentation and platform integration:

- **Profiles and platform security:** persistent profile metadata, last-used
  state, credential-store integration, and confirmation UI.
- **Mechanical render caches:** the latest typed, monotonic `AppCoreView`,
  `HostState`, Herd, terminal-rail, transcript, latency, and diagnostic
  projections needed to render without reconstructing native state machines.
- **Thin adapters:** one non-serializable `HerdrClient` facade per live host plus
  AppCore projection adapters. They forward typed semantic application/runtime
  operations and native views; they are not authoritative state owners.
- **Terminal presentation:** mounted WebView/xterm lifecycles, ANSI rendering,
  gestures, selection, scrollback, renderer caches, composer drafts, font size,
  and other presentation preferences. Rust owns the logical rail and transport;
  React owns how each rail entry is rendered.
- **Transcript persistence:** the platform SQLite adapter stores opaque Rust
  keys and blobs and confirms durable checkpoints; it does not interpret the
  transcript schema or identity. Fresh, synchronized Herdr projections provide
  a Rust-owned list of retained transcript keys, including unopened agents.
  Confirmed removal releases native and presentation state and prunes SQLite
  history, including caches from previous app runs. Namespace-ordered writes
  cannot recreate removed rows. Temporary detach, disconnect, and failed sync
  preserve history; a transcript shared by surviving panes is retained.
- **Platform surfaces:** navigation destinations, sheets, forms, pickers/share,
  previews, notifications, and presentation preferences. React may use
  transient optimistic workspace/tab/pane focus while a UI operation settles;
  Rust `AppCore` remains the durable, reconciled application selection.

Transport objects do not live in React component state. Rust owns application
state machines, SSH/API lifetimes, and connected-host domain truth; React
consumes typed versioned projections and invokes semantic actions through thin
facades. Client-side selection is distinct from Herdr server focus: changing
the former does not mutate the latter unless React invokes an explicit focus
operation.

## Mobile information architecture

### Hosts

A saved-host list is the entry surface. It shows identity, address, last connection result, and a primary connect action. Editing authentication is separate from operating a connected Herdr session.

### Herd

The attention surface can scope the queue to one live host or merge every live host. It orders agents by actionable status: blocked, done, working, idle, unknown, while preserving host, workspace, and pane context for terminal attachment and host-specific actions.

### Workspaces

Native workspace, tab, and pane navigation replaces the corresponding Herdr TUI
chrome. `AppCore` owns and reconciles durable client selection; React may show a
transient optimistic choice while an explicit focus operation changes server
focus. Closing a tab takes effect immediately, while other destructive
operations require confirmation.

### Terminal

An immersive terminal surface keeps a slim scrollable session rail, connection status, close/new actions, and a horizontally scrollable mobile key rail. Switching back to Herd, Hosts, or More must not disconnect or recreate terminal sessions.

### More

Connection details, notifications, speech, terminal preferences, known hosts, diagnostics, and disconnect are device-local settings. Server-owned Herdr settings should be clearly distinguished from mobile preferences.

More also presents device-local usage for today, this week (Monday start), this
month, and lifetime. A process-wide Rust tracker counts the union of foreground
time and background time with at least one fresh, working agent. Runtime events
update it before foreign callbacks, so background accounting does not depend on
React timers or mounted screens. React supplies lifecycle visibility, the app
documents path, and local calendar boundaries (including DST). Rust stores
disjoint usage spans and a lifetime total, atomically checkpointing
every 15 seconds and on activity transitions. A restart never resumes an old
interval; suspension gaps over five seconds and large clock changes are not
credited. Abrupt process death can lose up to one checkpoint interval. No remote
content or host identity is persisted in usage history.
The selectable usage chart groups those spans into local hours, days, months,
or years. Rust clips intervals at the supplied calendar boundaries, including
DST transitions; retaining spans keeps the lifetime chart available over time.

## Reliability rules

- Native activity launch is not proof that JavaScript rendered; visually inspect the expected screen.
- A stale control-plane connection must be visible and must not silently present old state as live.
- `HostRuntime` serializes reconnect attempts per host with bounded equal-jitter
  backoff, an explicit lifecycle state, monotonic epochs, and cancellation on
  user disconnect. A stale transport, event subscription, or terminal open may
  not replace a newer generation.
- During reconnect, retain known-good host state and mark it stale. Rust restarts
  the event subscription, performs a generation-guarded snapshot sync, and only
  marks the projection fresh after reconciliation. A failed read never becomes
  a successful empty snapshot.
- Terminal frames are byte-stream ANSI data carried through the typed UniFFI/JSI path. Do not convert the hot path to JSON strings or reinterpret partial UTF-8 before xterm receives the bytes.
- Keep control and terminal failures independent. One failed terminal must not disconnect the Herdr dashboard or other terminals.
- Backgrounding may suspend polling/rendering, but it must not imply that the remote Herdr session stopped.
